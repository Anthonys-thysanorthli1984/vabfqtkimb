Just got out of The Life List... wow. My ears still ringing from the theater, was it too loud or am I just old now? Gosh, this   though. Pieces are swirling in my head like... remember those old kaleidoscopes? Colors, places, and faces all bumping around.

The scene where she—where was it? Was it Prague, San Francisco?—she stood against that backdrop, air all golden, kinda like in those dreams where everything's too perfect. That moment when her hand brushed against the list and it seemed like magic could just explode if she willed it hard enough.

> Oh, the way she spoke to her dad, through snippets of those old home  s... made me think about Dad and the way his voice fades in my mind nowadays, like old radios losing signal but refusing to completely hush. 

Note to self: Popcorn crumbs have permanently lodged themselves between fingerprints, sticky reminders of buttery indulgence. My back aches like an old patchworked quilt got tangled up inside me, but god, the way it grounds you, being so engrossed in a story.

There was this part in the   where she compared time to a sugar cube dissolving into steaming coffee. It stuck. That ridiculous sense of sweetness evaporating, but transforming the whole thing, like I'm actually getting metaphysical about ☕️ now. Send this to philosophy club or something.

No, but the theater was so noisy? People like chattering like sparrows at dawn just as the climax was peaking. Like, c'mon people, it's a   not a group chat.

Someone needs to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   when it’s out, to catch all those sneaky little details shimmering beneath the surface. Or maybe I need to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again, cuz I missed some when that dude spilled his soda three rows back and turned into comic relief nobody asked for.

Didn’t Paul say he wanted to borrow this? Or was it Yolanda who asked? Gah, my brain, creaky like some old attic door.

static void LostInThought()
{
    IAmNotSureWhatToSayAnymore();
    RandomStringGenerator(xyzzy);
    while (true)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(Oops, did I leave the stove on?);
        RandomThoughts();
    }
}

Gonna go sit with this for a bit longer. 🍿🎬
